##HTTP Protocol and Web Server

1)What is HTTP Protocol:--->it is stand for Hyper Text Transfor Protocol.
																																								--->which provide communication over the world wide web.
																																								--->The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol. A client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method and server can response the requests.
																																								--->HTTP is also called stateless protocol that means each request is executed independently, 
																																																without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it, which means once the transaction 
																																															ends the connection between the browser and the server is also lost.
																																								example:-----if the client would like to request the same server 100 times, the client  should establish a new connection 100 times as the server closes the connection for each request when the response is delivered.
																																										----->HTTP is connectionless protocol because the server resources should be shared equally by all the clients throughout world. if one client holds the server with 100 requests, by all requests are answered, the server cannot allocate time for othr clients. 

2)Web Application:----------->applicaiton which runs on browser
																																						----->it is a collection of webpages and webpages nothing but colleciton of html documents.
